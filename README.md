# Filmstaden :movie_camera:

### Filmstaden is a front-end web application dedicated to cinemas and movies.

With the focus on front end usability, the web application makes use of Sqlite database to store bookings.
The front end of the web application automatically scales as JSON documents are filled with data.

:star: Thanks to `ironboy` for the front-end database solution.
